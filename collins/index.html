     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">“This concluding volume in Collins's Hunger Games trilogy accomplishes a rare feat, the last installment being the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level."
--Publishers Weekly,STARRED REVIEW</p>
     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">“...readers will instinctively understand what Katniss knows in her soul, that war mixes all the slogans and justifications, the deceptions and plans, the causes and ideals into an unsavory stew whose taste brings madness. That there is still a human spirit that yearns for good is the book’s primrose of hope."
--Booklist,STARRED REVIEW</p>
     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">“In the final analysis, this is exactly the book its fans have been hoping for. It will grab them and not let go, and if it leaves them with questions, well, then, it’s probably exactly the book Collins was hoping for, too."

     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"At its best the trilogy channels the political passion of “1984,” the memorable violence of “A Clockwork Orange,” the imaginative ambience of “The Chronicles of Narnia” and the detailed inventiveness of “Harry Potter.” The specifics of the dystopian universe, and the fabulous pacing of the complicated plot, give the books their strange, dark charisma."
--The New York Times, Katie Roiphe</p>
     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"This dystopic-fantasy series, which began in 2008, has had such tremendous crossover appeal that teens and parents may discover themselves vying for -- and talking about -- the family copy of "Mockingjay." And there's much to talk about because this powerful novel pierces cheery complacency like a Katniss-launched arrow. Look skeptically at computer and television images, it suggests, be aware of spin, gaze upon the young faces of the world's soldiers. Children forced to kill children? It's not just in the pages of a novel."
--The Washington Post</p>
     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"The indelible conclusion to Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy proves once more that the greatest fantasy novels hold an incandescent mirror up to reality."
--Parade, Parade Picks</p>
     <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-12 hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"But being the Mockingjay comes with a price as Katniss must come to terms with how much of her own humanity and sanity she can willingly sacrifice for the cause, her friends, and her family. Collins is absolutely ruthless in her depictions of war in all its cruelty, violence, and loss, leaving readers, in turn, repulsed, shocked, grieving and, finally, hopeful for the characters they've grown to empathize with and love."
--School Library Journal</p>
     <p class="col-lg-12 hidden-md hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"The final installment, the grimmest yet, is a riveting meditation on the costs of war...Clear your schedule before you start: This is a powerful, emotionally exhausting final volume."
--People Magazine,4 OUT OF 4 STARS</p>
     <p class="col-lg-12 hidden-md hidden-sm hidden-xs thumbnail">"Fans will be happy to hear that Mockingjay is every bit as complex and imaginative as Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot that follows Katniss as she tries to fulfill her role, protect her mother and sister and, in the end, finally choose between her two greatest loves. B+."
